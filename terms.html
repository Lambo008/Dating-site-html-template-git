					<h3 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h3>
					<h4 id="responsibilities-related-to-compliance-with-its-obligations">Responsibilities related to
						compliance with its obligations</h4>
					<p>NETME moderates the content published by Members when they register, in particular photos
						published by Members and the description added to a Member’s profile. However, the Member has
						sole responsibility for their own actions and the information they publish through the
						Application. If
						NETME is held liable for a Member’s failure to comply with their obligations, the Member shall
						guarantee NETME against any conviction handed down against it whose basis originates from a
						violation of the law or these TCU by the Member. </p>
					<p>Members may report prohibited content that violates applicable law or these TCU using the
						moderation tools provided by the Application in the menu found on each chat screen under the
						heading ‘Report’. </p>
					<h4 id="responsibilities-related-to-publishing-photos">Responsibilities related to publishing photos
					</h4>
					<p>Any photograph that is pornographic or exhibitionist in nature or violates modesty or is
						generally
						considered immoral is formally prohibited. NETME reserves the right to delete any photograph
						that
						does not comply with the conditions above. Publishing any such photograph constitutes a serious
						offence which could lead to the Member’s Account being suspended and/or terminated, without
						prejudice to any other sanctions that may be imposed by the justice system. </p>
					<h4 id="responsibilities-related-to-real-meetings">Responsibilities related to real meetings</h4>
					<p>NETME provides warnings to Members who wish to meet another Member in real life. Members
						are wholly responsible for verifying the identity of the people with whom they arrange any such
						meeting. Such ‘real’ meetings take place independently of NETME, and are the sole responsibility
						of the Members involved. NETME cannot be held liable for any actions or problems of any nature
						whatsoever committed or provoked by Members and/or former Members during events that take
						place following use of the Application. In this regard, the NETME messaging system enables users
						to decide which Members are authorised to view their profiles and communicate with them, with
						the aim of giving Members peace of mind and preserving their security. It is highly recommended
						that Members do not reveal personal information to other Members, even to those authorised to
						exchange Messages with them, that does not appear on their NETME profile, such as phone
						numbers, addresses or surnames. NETME strongly recommends that, for security reasons, Members
						only arrange real meetings in very busy public places or that they inform a family member or
						friend
						of the meeting, and only reveal their contact details after a reasonable period of time. </p>
					<h4 id="responsibilities-related-to-a-members-equipment">Responsibilities related to a Member’s
						equipment</h4>
					<p>Members are solely responsible for paying for the equipment (hardware or software) required to
						access the Services, and all other related costs, including telecommunication charges. Members
						are
						solely responsible for their own equipment used in connection with the Service. </p>
					<p>##Article 8 - NETME’s obligations and responsibilities</p>
					<h3 id="obligations-1">Obligations</h3>
					<p>NETME commits to providing the infrastructure and technical means required to provide a
						highquality Service to Members equipped with an iPhone handset running on the operating system
						iOS
						9.0 or later. NETME cannot be held responsible for any operational faults in a Member’s handset
						or
						any compatibility issues between the Application and the handset. All possible measures are
						taken
						to minimise the risk of fraudulent access to NETME systems. In this regard, NETME has put in
						place a firewall (located between the internet network and the company’s private network to
						increase the company’s security by filtering traffic originating from or going to the internet).
					</p>
					<p>Nevertheless, it is impossible to fully guarantee the security of a network. NETME is not
						responsible for any breakdowns, interruptions or malfunctions in the services provided by
						Members’ internet access providers, nor for any reason outside of NETME’s control that could
						interrupt or impair access to NETME Services. Members must ensure that they have a secure email
						address. Despite, or in the absence of, these precautions, a Member’s Account may be susceptible
						to
						fraud. </p>
					<p>NETME also wishes to warn Members of the exceptional risk of receiving unwanted Messages or
						Messages that purport to have been sent by NETME. Members must be aware of the risk and
						vigilant, and warn NETME by letter or by email sent to the address provided in Article 2 of this
						document should such a situation arise. </p>
					<h3 id="responsibilities-1">Responsibilities</h3>
					<p>NETME and its partners cannot be held responsible for any illegal actions or actions subject to
						criminal sanctions committed by its Members, including but not limited to:</p>
					<h4 id="criminal-behaviour">Criminal behaviour</h4>
					<p>NETME is not liable in cases of fraud, identity theft, prostitution, violation of the
						intellectual property of third parties or other criminal offences committed by its Members
						through the Site, the Application and the Services provided to them.</p>
					<h4 id="litigious-content">Litigious content</h4>
					<p>NETME reserves the right to save all litigious content, in particular in order to make it
						available to the competent authorities.</p>
					<h4 id="real-meetings">Real meetings</h4>
					<p>NETME is not responsible for real meetings organised by Members. Members who wish to organise
						such meetings are reminded that they do so at their own risk as indicated in Article 7 of these
						TCU,
						as NETME is unable to guarantee the truthfulness of information provided by its Members. </p>
					<h4 id="mass-demonstrations">Mass demonstrations</h4>
					<p>NETME prohibits Members or third parties from organising demonstrations or mass meetings of
						their members through the Site and/or the Application made available to Members. NETME cannot
						be held responsible for any disturbance to public order or damages caused by Members or third
						parties participating in such meetings. </p>

						third parties.</p>
					<h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
					<p>NETME UG, Stefan-George-Ring 55, 81929 München, Germany ("NETME UG" or "we/us/our")
						owns the domain “www.netme.eu" and all of its sub-pages ("NETME domain") where it provides

						is its principal means of running a platform for chatting with, getting to know and meeting
						other
						people (“NETME"). NETME UG is the data controller.</p>
					<p>The service offering is based on the freemium model allowing a NETME user ("user" or "you") to
						run the NETME app to create a profile ("user profile"), upload images, exchange messages etc.
						with
						other interested users and their user profiles for free. Users have access to various functions
						such as
						Chat, Nearby Localities or Send Invitations and many other NETME functions. Added to that,
						NETME offers a chargeable premium service for users who wish to gain access to further unique
						functions.</p>
					<p>NETME’s offering also lets you meet real people in your area and therefore classifies as a
						so-called

						<h2>1. How is my data collected, processed and used when I download the
							NETME app?</h2>
						<h3>1.1. NETME app download</h3>
						<p>When you download the NETME app, the relevant data will be transferred to the app store
							operator
							concerned. Depending on the app store, the set of data may include the app store user's
							e-mail
							address or customer number, the time of download and a unique device ID, for example.
							However,
							NETME UG has no influence on and is not the controller for processing this data. The privacy
							statements of the relevant app store operator apply</p>
						<br>
						<h3>1.2. Installation and access rights</h3>
						<p>NETME needs various access pathways and data to ensure the technical operability of the NETME
							app and to provide the services you can run using the NETME app.</p>
						<p>Depending on which operating system you use, the installer may already ask your permission to
							access specific functions and pieces of information. Such access rights cover the location,
							messages,
							mobile data and others. </p>
						<p>The user preferences of some terminal devices allow user to manually withdraw some of these
							rights. If you do, please bear in mind that not granting these rights may render the NETME
							app
							partly or completely useless. Access rights will be checked before or after the
							installation,
							depending on your app version.</p>
						<br>
						<h2>2. How does NETME collect, process and use my data if I just visit the NETME
							domain or the NETME app but do not create a user profile?</h2>
						<p>Unless the user explicitly consents, NETME UG uses the personal data disclosed by the user or
							generated when using NETME without creating a user profile solely for performance of the
							contractual relationship and as is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
							pursued by
							NETME UG use as described in this privacy statement.</p>
						<p>Except for the data listed below, NETME does not collect any personal data if you simply
							visit the
							NETME domain (starting on a so-called landing or home page) or install the NETME app without
							creating a user profile.</p>
						<p>The set of data contains:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>IP address</li>
							<li>name of requested website, file, date and time of request</li>
							<li>data volume transferred</li>
							<li>browser type and version</li>
							<li>referrer URL (source URL) from which the user opened the page - requesting provider
								plus, the
								data below transferred by the user's terminal device if the user just installs the NETME
								app but
								neither registers nor creates a user profile:</li>
							<li>push handle (for sending push messages)</li>
							<li>location data (GPS location), if the user has granted such a permission on the device.
							</li>
							<li>country code</li>
							<li>language</li>
							<li>device data, like manufacturer, device type, advertising-id, operating system and
								version of
								operating system.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>This data is required to use the NETME domain or to install the NETME app as such or they are
							used for analysis for statistical purposes in order to optimise NETME. This data is used to
							prevent
							and fight fake-profiles, illegal activity and spam and to secure the integrity and stability
							of the
							NETME platform. For this purpose, we may store the full data for up to 90 days.</p>
						<p>Collecting, processing and using the location data is necessary for the user to run the
							so-called
							"location-based service" which provides registered users with suggestions tailored to the
							user's
							location. Sections 3.2.</p>
						<br>
						<h2>3. How does NETME collect, process and use my data when I use the functions
							of the NETME app or the NETME domain after creating a user profile?</h2>
						<p>Unless the user explicitly consents, NETME UG uses the personal data disclosed by the user or
							generated when using NETME after creating a user profile solely for performance of the
							contractual
							relationship and as is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
							NETME UG
							use as described in this privacy statement. Proper use of NETME to the full extent requires
							the user
							to create a user profile. This involves entering further personal data which NETME UG uses
							to
							provide the service agreed.</p>
						<h3>3.1 Mandatory entries for creating a user profile</h3>
						<p>You must enter the following details to register and create a user profile:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>user name</li>
							<li>email address </li>
							<li>password</li>
							<li>date of birth</li>
							<li>sex</li>
							<li>profile picture</li>
							<li>description</li>
						</ul>
						<p>We collect, process and use the data you enter so that you can use NETME. Among other things
							it
							helps us address and authenticate you, personalise your profile and (in pseudonymous form)
							to
							show you ads (see section 4). </p>
						<p>We delete this data when you delete your account. The legal basis for this processing of
							personal
							data is Article 6 (1) b) or Article 6 (1) f) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
							(GDPR).</p>
						<h3>3.2 Location data</h3>
						<p>NETME's offering includes so-called location-based services which display specific localities
							to the
							user's location. A user can therefore be shown other users in the vicinity. To be able to
							provide these
							functions within the NETME app, NETME collects location data by means of GPS of the terminal
							device concerned as well as location data of nearby radio access nodes. Provided that the
							site survey
							is enabled, and permission is granted, the location will be periodically transferred to
							NETME UG
							and will be respectively processed and used.</p>
						<p>Before collection of location data, users must allow the collection of location data. The
							location
							data is then processed in accordance with this privacy statement. If activated and granted,
							the
							location data is transferred to NETME UG at regular intervals to be processed and used.</p>
						<p>Users can change this functionality at any time by displaying the Preferences of their
							terminal
							device's operating system at any time to either allow or disallow the collecting of location
							data or
							within the app itself. </p>
						<p>Location data will also be used for advertising purposes, if the user has not objected to
							this in the
							app settings. (See section 4 for information about advertising).</p>
						<p>We store location data unshortend for up to 14 days and shortened up to 90 days. The legal
							basis for
							this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) or f) of the EU General Data Protection
							Regulation (GDPR). </p>
						<h3>3.3 Payment data</h3>
						<p>External payment service providers handle the transactions involved when a user does any
							In-App
							purchases via NETME, buys credits or subscribes to our chargeable premium service. NETME UG
							neither collects nor processes any payment data of shopping transactions. Instead, the
							payment
							service providers take care of entering and processing the payment data directly. All that
							NETME
							and the payment service providers do is to exchange technical data (e.g. the transaction ID)
							in order
							to validate the purchases. We save this data until your user account is deleted or beyond
							this point,
							until a time when the data is no longer subject to any tax-related, commercial or other
							statutory
							storage obligations. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1)
							b) of the EU
							General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

						<h2>4. How does NETME use my data for advertising?</h2>
						<p>We use data for advertising in two regards:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>For our own advertising</li>
							<li>To display personalised advertising.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>4.1 How is my data used for NETME’s own advertising? </h3>
						<p>We display ads of our own to our users on our platform and also inform them by e-mail, e.g.
							about
							one-off campaigns, discounted package prices or similar offers. In order to be able to
							display
							suitable offers, we use information provided by the user (such as profile data) and
							information that
							we automatically receive through the use of our platform. </p>
						<p>The user can object to the use for advertising purposes at any time by deactivating
							personalised
							advertising in the app settings under Privacy and or in his device settings or in the
							settings on the
							website. </p>
						<p>The data transfer takes place exclusively as described under 6. </p>
						<p>The legal basis for this processing is the legitimate interest of NETME according to Art. 6 I
							lit. f
							DSGVO. </p>
						<h3>4.2 How does NETME use my data for personalised advertising?</h3>
						<p>NETME UG decided to run NETME as a freemium service which lets every user obtain a basic
							NETME version free of charge. Users of the free version will be shown ads. The ads shown in
							NETME contain our own advertising matters (such as the premium products of NETME) or content
							ordered by an advertising firm in so-called campaigns. Campaigns may be personalised to
							tailor
							them to specific user groups. Some ads shown in NETME are mediated by external service
							providers. </p>

						<h3>4.2.1 Which data is used for advertising and who is it given to?</h3>
						<p>NETME UG can use NETME to show third-party ads which may be tailored to the users' assumed
							specific interests (personalised ads) or targeted to certain user groups grouped by age,
							location or
							gender. The users can object to the use of its data in the privacy settings of the app or
							the device
							settings. We and our advertising partners will only use non-sensitive data, that the you
							have
							published on NETME and information about your device and your connection. Under no
							circumstances will we share your name, your e-mail address, your profile picture or your
							exact
							location or similar data that allows a direct inference of your real person with our
							advertising
							partners.</p>
						<p>Whenever such personalised ads are shown, the third-party provider whose ad is shown in NETME
							or whose services are used to show ads of other third parties the following pseudonymous
							data may
							be transferred ("forwarded data”): </p>
						<ul>
							<li>advertiser ID</li>
							<li>your published age and gender</li>
							<li>your coarse location</li>
							<li>technical data of the terminal device</li>
							<li>NETME usage data</li>
							<li>data of ads shown</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Forwarded data is disclosed to the following categories of recipients for the purposes
							explained: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>ad network operators </li>
							<li>tracking services operators</li>
							<li>affiliate networks</li>
							<li>customer relationship services operators </li>
							<li>other sales & marketing partners </li>
						</ul>
						<p>You can object to this processing for the future at any time by going to the privacy settings
							of the
							NETME app or the device settings. You can also reset your Advertising ID in your device
							settings.
							In that case a new Advertising ID is created which will not be joined with older data. With
							this you
							can ensure, that you will not see any ads based on the forwarded data before you have
							objected to
							the transfer. </p>
						<p>All our partners are obligated to process forwarded data only on accordance with the high
							data
							protection principles of the European Union and only for advertising purposes. This means,
							that all
							partners are obligated no not identify the real user / or remove the Pseudonymity of the
							data. </p>

						<h3>4.2.2. What is an advertiser ID and how is it used?</h3>
						<p>For tracking and advertising, the NETME app uses the so-called advertiser ID, i.e. the
							"Advertiser
							Identifier" (IDFA) for offerings of Apple Inc. and the "Android Advertiser ID" (advertiser
							ID) for
							offerings of Google. Inc. (jointly the "advertiser ID(s)"). These advertiser IDs are unique
							nonpermanent numbers identifying a specific terminal device. They are provided by iOS for
							offerings
							of Apple Inc. or by Android for offerings of Google Inc. As opposed to vendor advertiser IDs
							(generated by latest-generation operating systems and identical for the apps of just one
							provider),
							the advertiser ID is the same as the one transferred to other companies when running their
							apps. The
							user can deactivate the generation of the Advertiser-ID. On an apple device this can be done
							in the
							iOS preferences, under "Privacy" -- "Ads" by enabling the option "no ad tracking"; for a
							user
							owning an Android this can be achieved by opening the "Google Settings" (or first "Settings"
							and
							then "Google"), clicking on "Display" and ticking the option "Disable personalised ads. The
							Advertiser ID is pseudonymous and NETME UG will not be joined with other user data to
							identify
							him for advertising purposes. </p>
						<p>The Advertiser ID will be used by NETME UG and our advertising partner as described above to
							show you personalised advertising and to analyse this advertising. You can always object to
							this
							pseudonymous use by disabling the Advertiser ID as described above or objecting in the
							privacy
							settings of our app. </p>

						<h3>4.2.3. Using location data </h3>
						<p>Apart from collecting the location data by running GPS Location to enable the location-based
							services, NETME UG collects and uses other location data to show the user ads in NETME
							tailored
							to the user's location and profile. NETME UG will never forward the exact location to our
							advertising partners. To protect your privacy all provided location data is coarse by around
							2 km. To
							our knowledge with this data the identification of an individual is not or only with an
							unreasonable
							and illegal measures possible.</p>
						<p>For users that are sensitive to privacy question, we offer a separate option in the apps
							privacy
							settings to object of the use of location data for the future.</p>

						<h3>4.2.4. Legal basis for the use of personal data for advertising purposes</h3>
						<p>NETME UG bases the processing of sharing of the above data on the performance of the contract
							with you (Article 6 (1) b) GDPR in connection with Nr. 11.2. of our Terms of Service), your
							consent
							(Article 6 (1) a) GDPR) and the legitimate interests pursued by us (Article 6 (1) f) GDPR).
						</p>
						<p>We offer our users a service under the Freemium model, which means, that certain parts of
							NETME
							are free to use. In Exchange for using the NETME platform without charge, NETME UG displays
							personalised advertisings and process and shares pseudonymous data as specified above. </p>
						<p>Pre-requirement for all data transfer is that the recipient ensures by contractual, legal,
							technical and
							organisational measure that the data processing is always in compliance with privacy law.
						</p>
						<p>The users consents to the data use and transfer to the recipients above when using the free
							version
							of the app. </p>
						<p>We have decided to only share data, which (even in the event of an unlawful disclosure or by
							hacking of our partners) is not sensitive for individual users. We thus only share data in
							pseudonymous form and only data that the user has made public or is, by its nature, not
							sensitive
							like device and network data. </p>
						<p>NETME will only pass on data that has been voluntarily made public on the NETME platform by
							the user and therefore shows a low level of sensitivity to the user and device or connection
							data
							which, due to their very nature, have are not sensitive. </p>

						<h2>5. How are social media and Like buttons integrated? </h2>
						<p>The NETME domain contains links to NETME UG accounts with the following social networks:
							Instagram and Facebook. After clicking on the embedded picture, you will be taken to the
							associated Instagram and Facebook page. That is to say that user data will not be
							transferred to the
							provider until you click on a link. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is
							Article 6 (1)
							a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
						<p>Provided that you and your user profile are logged in to the social destination network at
							the time,
							your click on the button will be associated with your visit to NETME.</p>
						<p>If you do not wish the social media to collect data via the NETME domain, we recommend that
							you
							log off your social network before you visit the NETME domain. But even so, one with an ID
							will
							be uploaded when you click on the button and run NETME. This function may therefore collect
							data and create a profile which may then be traced back to a specific natural person. If you
							do not
							wish this to happen, just visit the NETME domain and click on the correct option to disable
							the
							function. Or you can set your browser to never accepting any cookies; please note that this
							may
							restrict the functionality of NETME.</p>

							<h3>5.1 Facebook-Connect</h3>
							<p>NETME UG allows you to run Facebook-Connect to log in to NETME. To log in, you will be
								forwarded to the Facebook page (operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo
								Alto, CA
								94304, USA) where you use your user data to log in if not logged in yet. A single click
								then links
								your Facebook profile to your NETME user profile. This link then automatically provides
								NETME
								UG with your Facebook data, i.e. your e-mail address and other details stored with your
								public
								Facebook profile. Your public Facebook profile shows all data you have made publicly
								known via
								Facebook. A public Facebook profile normally consists of the following details: your
								name, profile
								picture, sex, language, country, age bracket, Facebook ID, friends, likes and your
								relationship
								status. </p>
							<p>Of these details provided by Facebook, NETME UG just uses your e-mail address, Facebook
								ID,
								profile picture and your date of birth. These details go into your user profile. For
								further information
								about Facebook-Connect and its privacy settings please visit <a
									href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php"
									target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>
								and read Facebook's privacy rules and terms of use.</p>
							<p>The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) a) of the EU
								General Data
								Protection Regulation (GDPR). </p>

							<h2>6. How is data disclosed or forwarded?</h2>
							<p>NETME UG does not forward the personal data of its users to third parties, unless the
								user
								explicitly agrees, or such forwarding is required or permitted by law. </p>

							<h3>6.1 General notes on the forwarding of personal data </h3>
							<p>User and other data</p>
							<p>NETME UG may transfer customer data to the following third parties if such data concern
								the
								execution of the contract:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>External service providers and their agents. NETME UG may order external companies
									or
									persons to process customer data. </li>
								<li>Affiliated companies as processor. NETME UG may instruct affiliated companies to
									process
									customer data. </li>
								<li>Affiliated companies as controller. NETME UG may transfer customer data to other
									members of
									the company group for internal administrative purposes. Legal basis for such a
									transfer is Art. 6
									(1) lit. f GDPR with recital nr. 48 GDPR. </li>
							</ul>

							<p>Other disclosures</p>
							<p>NETME UG may transfer customer data to the following third parties if such data concern
								the
								execution of the contract:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Subject to changes to its organisation. In conjunction with mergers, acquisitions,
									bankruptcy or
									liquidation proceedings, restructuring measures, divestment of some of all of NETME
									UG's
									assets, funding procedures, acquisition of some or all of our business, similar
									transactions or
									proceedings or steps having regard to such activities (e.g. due diligence
									investigations). </li>
								<li>Subject to statutory regulations. In order to comply with statutory regulations or
									authority
									constraints and in response to legitimate inquiries, court orders and legal
									procedures. </li>
								<li>Subject to enforcing NETME UG's rights, to preventing fraud and to ensuring safety.
									To protect
									and defend the rights, property and/or safety of NETME UG or third parties,
									including the
									enforcement of contracts and directives and in support of investigating and
									preventing cases of
									fraud. </li>
								<li>NETME UG may use aggregate data or data not containing any personally identifiable
									facts for
									any purpose. For business or analysis purposes NETME UG may thus forward such
									aggregate
									data or data not containing any personally identifiable facts to partners or others
									by publishing the
									number of messages sent via NETME on a specific day, for example. </li>
								<li>We may share customer data in pseudonymous form with our advertising partners, see
									section 4.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>6.2 Categories of data recipients</h3>
							<p>NETME UG gives third parties access to your personal data only if this is necessary for
								our own
								business purpose (especially performance of contract), with your consent, if is covered
								by our own
								legitimate interest, or when we are obliged to on legal grounds, by court order, or at
								the request of
								another official authority. </p>
							<p>We work together with external service providers for our data processing. This is usually
								carried out
								on an order processing basis, whereby we remain responsible for data processing. We
								review each
								of these service providers beforehand with regard to the measures they have undertaken
								to ensure
								data protection and data security, thereby safeguarding the contractual provisions as
								stipulated by
								law for the protection of the personal data. </p>
							<p>Depending on which services are provided, NETME UG may also ask affiliated companies to
								act as
								data processing services provider for providing some or all of the services offered its
								customers.</p>

							<h2>7. How is data processed and used to prevent and fight fake-profiles, illegal
								activity and spam and to secure the integrity and stability of the NETME
								platform?</h2>
							<p>Personal data is used as described below used to prevent and fight fake-profiles, illegal
								activity and
								spam and to secure the integrity and stability of the NETME platform. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>IP and email addresses are saved to detect spam & scam for as long as the user is
									active.</li>
								<li>Messages are automatically checked for specific keywords but not saved for this
									purpose.</li>
								<li>Personal data such as an active user's sex, age and location is saved and pooled
									with other nonpersonal data in order to detect any abnormalities.</li>
								<li>Whereas previous phone numbers are saved to check suspicious profiles sent by SMS,
									such phone numbers cannot be associated with the verified user.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>8. How is data deleted and back-ups created? </h2>
							<p>Deleting a user profile (attention: not by deleting the NETME app!) or notifying us
								accordingly
								deletes all of that user's data. Apart from that, users can remove profile details
								themselves or ask us
								to do so at any time. </p>
							<p>Exempt of such a deletion is data, that we have to retain by statutory storage
								obligations, for
								winding up the contract and for performance of contract with other users. For example,
								we will not
								promptly delete the following data: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Payment data and data regarding reward claims, which we have to retain for
									tax-related,
									commercial or other statutory storage obligations. </li>
								<li>Data, which you have shared with other users in chats, like messages or pictures
									(see below)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>When do we delete data, that you have shared with other users? </p>
							<p>We delete data which is accessible in your public profile, like profile pictures, stream
								pictures and
								profile data, promptly as specified above.</p>
							<p>We can't delete data that you have shared non-publicly with other users without
								infringing the rights
								of this other user. Thus, we can delete chat data only after both users have delete
								their profile.</p>
							<p>How long will it take to delete the data?</p>
							<p>Such details will be immediately removed from the productive databases and, thus from the
								NETME interface; however, it may take up to 14 days until the data is removed from all
								of
								NETME’s server layers, cache memories and back-up databases.</p>
							<p>If deletion is not possible, we will anonymise the data or restrict the processing.</p>
							<p>In case certain facts lead to the suspicion that a user profile uses NETME illegally or
								contrary to the
								contract with us, we reserve the right to check and perhaps save profile files before
								deleting them.
								This is to protect the users of NETME UG's offerings.</p>
							<p>Irrespective of data deleted because of user-deleted profiles, NETME automatically and
								periodically
								deletes historical data no longer needed to perform the contract (e.g. historical
								location details and
								IP data). </p>

							<h2>9. How does NETME ensure data integrity? </h2>
							<p>The trust of its users and protecting their data is of great importance to NETME UG. To
								prevent
								unauthorised access to or disclosure of user data and to ensure the integrity and
								appropriate use of
								the data, NETME has appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures in
								place to
								protect the information collected by NETME UG. </p>
							<p>To provide highest-level protection of the user data, the offerings of the NETME domain
								or
								NETME app rely on a secure SSL connection that allows the transfer of nothing but
								encrypted data. </p>

							<h2>10. User rights: consent and withdrawal of consent, information, correction,
								deletion, transfer</h2>

							<h3>10.1 Consent and withdrawal of consent </h3>
							<p>When registering with NETME, users agree to collecting, saving and processing their
								personal data
								subject to this Privacy Statement and our General Terms and Conditions. Users will have
								to
								explicitly consent to this procedure when they create their user profile. NETME UG logs
								both the
								granting of the consent and the entire process of user profile creation. </p>
							<p>Users can withdraw their consent at any time and with future effect. Methods of doing so
								is by
								deleting their user profile (not the NETME app), going to the specified user profile
								places in the
								NETME app or NETME domain or by sending us an email, fax or letter to: </p>
							<p>LETTER: NETME UG, Stefan-George-Ring 55, 81929, Munich, Germany</p>
							<p>EMAIL: <a href="mailto:datenschutz@netme.eu">datenschutz@netme.eu</a></p>

							<h3>10.2 Information, correction, deletion, transfer</h3>
							<p>Subject to the applicable laws, users have a right to being informed about their personal
								data stored
								and a right to correcting, deleting and/or transferring such data, if so.</p>
							<p>To exercise these rights, users may send an email to <a
									href="mailto:datenschutz@netme.eu">datenschutz@netme.eu</a>.</p>
							<p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>

							<h2>11. Changes to this privacy statement </h2>
							<p>NETME UG will update this privacy statement as necessary. Using the user data is subject
								to the
								most recent version available for download at <a href="https://www.netme.eu/privacy"
									target="_blank">https://www.netme.eu/privacy.</a> An email will be sent
								to the email address stored with the user profile to inform users about major changes to
								this
								statement (e.g. changes to the user rights, new functions, new contact persons etc.). By
								continued
								access to and use of NETME after such changes have taken effect, users declare their
								consent to
								being legally bound to the revised privacy statement. </p>

							<h2>12. Privacy contact person and data protection officer </h2>
							<p>If you have questions concerning the collection, processing or use of your personal data,
								if you wish
								to be informed, to correct, bar or delete any data or to withdraw a previous consent,
								please do one of
								the following: delete your user profile (not the NETME app) or go to the specified user
								profile
								places in the NETME app or NETME domain and modify your user profile there
								or send us an email or letter to:</p>
